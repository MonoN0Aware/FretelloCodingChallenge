# Fretello Challenge


This is a ReadMe to introduce the Fretello Challenge application.

This application was created entirely in Xcode, with the help of a single external library, Kingfisher which was installed via Cocapods. As such, to run this application you should open the .xcworkspace application.
 
In the implementation of the final step, I encountered a number of  challenges related to how I was displaying the information in the table. As a result, the application now uses an XIB to dequeue the table cells. Hopefully this can suffice as an explanation as to why the setup of the table is so different from that of steps 1-3.

 -The application was built using the basic MVC structure
- To run the app, One will have to install pods. To do so, navigate to the project folder in terminal and type 'pod install'
 
 
 I really learned a lot while doing this task. It isn't perfect and I do welcome any suggestions on how I might do this better.
